2011.11.17 Version 1.3 (stable)

Core

* #6 Fixed a bug that throws an exception when the file is smaller than 132 bytes
  and not a DICOM file. Now the error is set in the errors array and a Nanodicom
  object is returned.
  
* #8 Added support to return profiling data in different units. Default is ms. Only
  seconds (s) and milliseconds (ms) supported.

Getter (Tool)

* #7 Added a new tool: Getter. Almost the same thing, but forces to load dictionaries
  for convenience. Otherwise, traditional code will not load dictionaries 
  (improves performance).

nanodcm (Command line tool)

* Nanodicom from the command line!
  - Run it recursively or not.
  - Specified the path to search.
  - Specified the mask to use for the file pattern
  - Display errors and warnings
  - Do dumping of multiple files in a single run.
  - Anonymize your files. Creates backups for you.

2011.09.08, Version 1.2 (stable)

Core

* #3 added support for partial reading of DICOM objects. Basically, parse does
  not throw an error anymore. A public "status" variable is updated accordingly:
  0 => Initial (Not parsed yet), 1 => Partial (Some tags were read),
  2 => Success (Is it a DICOM file), 3 => Failure (Not a DICOM file). Dumping
  or the object still can be performed, but only up to the number of tags found.
  
* #5 added support for AT vr reading and writing.

* added a summary method that displays most important information about the object.

* adedd "get" method that allows to pass a default value which will be returned
  if no value is found.

* "errors" and "warnings" are now saved in their corresponding public arrays.

* method "is_dicom" now parses the full dicom object and returns true or false
  based on status after being parsed.

Framework

* #4 added test suites.

Anonymizer

* added support to pass a list of replacement values. Great when replacements need
  to be consistent over different number of runs.
  
Pixeler

* added support for RLE compression, jpeg 8-bit lossy and uncompressed data.

* added support to read Monochrome1 and Monochrome2 or Paletter color photometric
  representations

* added support to read Planar Configuration of 0 (Color-by-pixel RGBRGB...)
  and 1 (Color-by-plane RRRR...GGGG...BBBB...)

* added support for multiple drivers (libraries). Works with gd (default),
  imagick (Image Magick) and gmagick (Gmagick). To change driver just call
  ->set_driver('imagick') before doing ->get_images().

* saving images handle jpg (default), png and gif.
